## Basic React App
Wanted a quick way to start a react project without using create-react-app. I find create-react-app too fat. I'm just weird.

Very basic React setup with Webpack and Babel:
- SourceMaps
- Hot Module Replacement

### Getting Started
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. Open http://localhost:3000

### Other useful information
- `npm run build` will create a production build in dist/
- Webpack is only configured with `babel-loader` add more loaders by configuring webpack config as needed

Have fun! I wish future me the best of luck with your next project. ;)
